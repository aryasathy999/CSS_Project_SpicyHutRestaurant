    A chemical equation (see an example below) consists of a list of reactants (the starting substances) on the left-hand side, an anow symbol, and a list of products (substances formed in the chemical reaction) on the right-hand side. Each substance is specified by its chemical formula, optionally preceded by a number called stoichiometric coefficient The coeficient specifies how many entities (eg molecules) of that substance are involved in the reaction on a molecular basis. If not written explicitly, the coefficient is equal to 1. Multiple substances on any side of the equatiori are separated from each other by a plus sign.
    As an example, the equation for the reaction of hydrochloric acid with sodium can be denoted
    2HCI-2Na-2NaCl+H
