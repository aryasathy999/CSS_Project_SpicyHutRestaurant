        My name is Yuki Fuminaga from Japan. I have 6 people in my family. Traveling to other countries each year has become our family custom since I was born We start to travel overacas when the year I was born We went to America, Australia, France, and England, China, Kerca and Taiwan. My mam especially loves traveling She is always talking about traveling when the time comes close to a vocation I heard from my mom, my dad use to nat like to go traveling but my mom took him every year. He began to like traveling since then

    Now I have grown up. Our family lives separately. My parents and grandmother are living in Japan where I was bom. I have two elder brothers who are living in China for studies, and I am living in U.S.A also for studies. But of course we will go to travel this year too. We probably go to Germany in this summer vocation where the place my mom wants to go.

    As for me wherever I am traveling with my family, it is always much fun and meaningful, since we have less time together
